    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      When you first open your source-code editor such as Visual Studio Code you can easily get your hand 
      on HTML boilerplate code such as the one shown below.
    </p> 
      <img src="boilerplate-code.PNG"/>
    <p>
      First, you will see The document type declaration (or doctype). 
      A doctype is simply a way to tell the browser or any other parser what type of document it’s looking at.
      Second is the <span class="html-tag"> &lt;html&gt; </span>   element and from here on you will start writing your HTML code.
       The lang attributes with value en is specifying that the following document is in English.
       The <span class="html-tag"> &lt;html&gt; </span> element is divided into two parts, 
       the <span class="html-tag"> &lt;head&gt; </span> and <span class="html-tag"> &lt;body&gt; </span> sections. 
      The <span class="html-tag">&lt;body&gt;</span>  section contains everything that’s displayed in the 
      browser — text, images, and so on. So, what is the significance of the <span class="html-tag"> &lt;head&gt; </span>  section...
    </p>  
     <h2>&lt;head&gt; section</h2> 
     <p>
      The <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> section is said to be a metadata holder. What is metadata? it is nothing but "data about the data(on the website)". 
        This data is generally not shown to end-user but by using metadata correctly, you can boost your relevancy in search results. 
        Metadata provides search engines with the most important information about your web pages, including titles and descriptions. 
        When someone searches Google for an image, your metadata is what tells the search engine you have the photo in need.
     </p>
     <h2>Tags used in &lt;head&gt; section</h2>
     <p>
      <span>&lt;meta&gt;</span> tag:  Used to specify a character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. 
      The first line inside the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> section of an HTML document is the one that defines the character encoding for the document using this <span>&lt;meta&gt;</span> tag.
      <span>&lt;title&gt;</span> tag: As its name suggests it specifies the title of the webpage which will appear on the browser tab which makes navigation in the browser easier. 
      It provides the title for the web page when it is added to favorites.
      <span class="html-tag">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag: You can put your style information(CSS) here. 
      Although it is recommended to create a separate stylesheet.
